# Project Description:

During this project we were given  website that had many redundant CSS and HTML elements and tags throughout the structure.  When approaching this project the object was to streamline the HTML and the CSS to make all of the syntax match and ensure there’s a logical flow throughout the page.  Some of the code was consolidated to apply the Scout’sRule in order to leave the code a little cleaner than it was found.  There were also some links that were corrected so they would function properly. ALT attributes were added in order to provide more accessibility to the webpage as a whole.
